# LanguageParser
This is a project in which I created my own language and then parse it using the concepts of automata(i.e CFG). I have included all the test cases that i used to check my parser and a pdf file in which the language specification and it CFG is written.
The one has to open the source.txt and write query in it the my parser will tell according to language rules, if the given query is valid or not. If the query wont be valid this parser will raise appropriate error.
Parser is created usng python language and is following all the concepts of OOP
